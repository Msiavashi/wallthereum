# Contribute
For now the platform supports only `ether` transactions. there is alot of features that could be inluded in the platform, but two priorities are Android/IOS applications and `ERC20` token transaction.
currently im working on Android app myself, so any contribution on `ERC20 token` transactions & `IOS` application is appreciated.
